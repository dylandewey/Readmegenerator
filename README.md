# Good README Generator
    
## Description:
    This application makes it easy to generate a good README file for your project.  It will ask you the questions in the terminal and as you fill in the answers it will put them in the correct place on the README file.  The file contains a table of contents and links to each section.  It also has a license at the top that links to the Github Repository for the project.

## Installation:
    To install this README Generator you must have the latest version of node.js installed on your computer.
    
## Usage:
    To run this file you type "node index.js" within the readmegenerator file in the terminal.  I was trying to get it so I could use the "module.exports = " but I haven't been able to figure that out yet.  I will make that work so it is easier to use this application from other files.
